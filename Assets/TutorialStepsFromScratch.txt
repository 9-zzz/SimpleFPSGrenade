* - Lighting settings, why is my scene not the right color... 

1 - Rename MainCamera to SimplePlayer add simple movement script from default project

2 - Make movement script even simpler, explain no jumping or rigidbody

3 - Create Ground 50x50 add material, needs collider

4 - Reload scene from pressing 'R' code

5 - Create simple canvas for simple crosshair, small square, rotated 45

6 - Add cube group with rigidbodies to shoot 

7 - Create simple gun with cubes, parent to an empty object to 'GunContainer', create point from which rays will shoot
7 - Click on main cube to instantiate centered empty object 'GunEnd', place outside collider.... no colliders on gun parts
